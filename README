This is yoshi, a LISP-1 interpreter written in C. (The syntax and semantics are actually more like Scheme.)

The name is from Mario games, but this is apropos of nothing.

I wanted to keep things all in one file for simplicity. It might be a little disorganized as a result. I hope it's not too tough to follow.

The eval/apply definitions are based on SICP 4.1.

This program leaks memory like a sieve. Deal with it.

Actually, this is mostly because I was too lazy to write a garbage collector for it. Maybe I'll get around to it.

RIP Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy.
