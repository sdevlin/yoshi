This is yoshi, a LISP-1 interpreter written in C. (The syntax and semantics are Scheme-like.)

I wanted to keep things all in one file for simplicity. It might be a little disorganized as a result. I hope it's not too tough to follow.

The eval/apply definitions are based on SICP 4.1. The list of built-in functions I chose to include is mostly based on Peter Norvig's lispy. (Most diversions are due to fixnum's being the sole numeric type I support.)

This program leaks memory like a sieve. Deal with it.

Actually, this is mostly because I was too lazy to write a garbage collector for it. Maybe I'll get around to it.

RIP Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy.
